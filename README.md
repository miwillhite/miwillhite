# Hi, I'm Matt Willhite

### A results-driven Senior Software Engineer looking for a job with impact.

#### I've been working on software that helps people for the last 8 years and can't imagine doing anything else.

I love manipulating data, refactoring old code, and solving difficult problems. Primary skill set: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.

### You won't find much here at the moment, all my efforts have been tied up in private projects!
